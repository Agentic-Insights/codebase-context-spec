# Context Editor

The Context Editor is a sample web application designed to help users create and edit Codebase Context Specification files easily. This tool demonstrates the practical application of the Codebase Context Specification and serves as a reference implementation for developers looking to integrate context creation into their workflows.

## Architecture Overview

The Context Editor follows a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture using React and TypeScript. The main components of the application include:

1. Header: Displays the application title and navigation (if applicable).
2. ContextForm: The main form component that allows users to input context information.
3. Various Section components (MetadataSection, ArchitectureSection, etc.): Handle specific sections of the context file.
4. MarkdownContentSection: Allows users to input free-form Markdown content.

The application uses a unidirectional data flow, where user input is captured in the ContextForm component, which then generates the final context file.

## Development Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks for all React components.
- Leverage TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
- Follow React best practices, including proper state management and component composition.
- Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
- Implement accessibility features to make the application usable by all.

## Setup and Running the Application

1. Ensure you have Node.js v14+ and npm installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Use `npm start` to run the application in development mode.
5. Use `npm test` to run the test suite.
6. Use `npm run build` to create a production build.

## Business Context

The Context Editor aims to simplify the process of creating and editing Codebase Context Specification files. Key features include:

- An intuitive user interface for inputting context information
- Support for YAML front matter and Markdown content
- Real-time preview of the generated context file
- Export functionality to save the created .context.md file

The target audience is developers who are using or plan to use the Codebase Context Specification in their projects. Success will be measured by user adoption rates, ease of use (gathered through user feedback), and the accuracy of generated context files.

## Quality Assurance

Our QA process ensures a high-quality, reliable application through:

- Unit and integration testing using Jest and React Testing Library
- A minimum test coverage threshold of 80%
- Performance benchmarks for initial load time and UI responsiveness
- Accessibility testing to ensure WCAG compliance

## Deployment and Operations

The Context Editor is deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages:

1. Developers push code to the GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions run tests and build the application
3. Successful builds are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages

The production environment is accessible at https://example.com/context-editor (replace with the actual URL when available).
