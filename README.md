# Codebase Context Specification (CCS) v 1.0.0-RFC

![Codebase Context Image](./img/codebase-context.png "Codebase Context Specification")

## Introduction

Welcome to the [Codebase Context Specification (CCS)](./CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md) repository! This project establishes a standardized method for embedding rich contextual information within codebases to enhance understanding for both AI and human developers. By providing a clear and consistent way to communicate project structure, conventions, and key concepts, we significantly improve code comprehension and facilitate more effective collaboration between humans and AI in software development.

## Codebase Context: A New Convention

The Codebase Context Specification introduces a convention similar to `.env` and `.editorconfig` systems, but focused on documenting your code for both AI and humans. Just as `.env` files manage environment variables and `.editorconfig` ensures consistent coding styles, CCS files (`.context.md`, `.context.yaml`, `.context.json`) provide a standardized way to capture and communicate the context of your codebase.

This convention allows developers to:
1. Document high-level architecture and design decisions
2. Explain project-specific conventions and patterns
3. Highlight important relationships between different parts of the codebase
4. Provide context that might not be immediately apparent from the code itself

By adopting this convention, teams can ensure that both human developers and AI assistants have access to crucial contextual information, leading to better code understanding, more accurate suggestions, and improved overall development efficiency.

## Key Concepts

- **Contextual Metadata**: Structured information about the project, its components, and conventions, designed for both human and AI consumption.
- **AI-Human Collaborative Documentation**: Guidelines for creating documentation that's easily parsed by AI models while remaining human-readable and maintainable.
- **Standardized Context Files**: Consistent use of `.context.md`, `.context.yaml`, and `.context.json` files for conveying codebase context at various levels (project-wide, directory-specific, etc.).
- **Context-Aware Development**: Encouraging a development approach that considers and documents the broader context of code, not just its immediate functionality.

## Current Version

**Version**: 1.0-preview

The Codebase Context Specification is currently in a preview state. We're actively seeking feedback and contributions from the developer community to refine and improve the specification before its official release.

## Specification

For the full specification, please refer to [CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md](CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md).

## Tooling Recommendations

Developers are encouraged to create:

- Memory systems using git branches as storage
- Linters and validators for context files
- IDE plugins for context file creation and editing
- AI model integrations for parsing and utilizing context
- Tools for aggregating and presenting project-wide context
- Agents that can help create context in codebases that are blank
- Codebase summariziers, submodule summarizers
- Memory systems that take advantage of the context
- Continuous TODO monitors that can re-try implementations / solutions

## Future Directions

1. Integration with existing documentation systems
2. Dynamic context generation through code analysis
3. Potential support for explicit context overriding
4. Agent tool / context matching and references

## Contribution / RFC Process

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help shape the final specification. Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Review the Specification**: Start by thoroughly reading the current specification in CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md.
2. **Open an Issue**: For suggestions, questions, or concerns, open an issue in this repository.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: For proposed changes or additions, submit a pull request with a clear description of your modifications.
4. **Join the Discussion**: Participate in open discussions and provide your insights on existing issues and pull requests.

All contributions will be reviewed and discussed openly. Significant changes may go through an RFC (Request for Comments) process to ensure thorough consideration and community input.
