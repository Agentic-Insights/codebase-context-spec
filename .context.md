# Codebase Context Specification

This is the root directory for the Codebase Context Specification project. The specification defines a standardized way to provide explicit context information about a codebase, enabling more effective AI-assisted development.

## Project Structure

- `CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md`: The main specification document
- `examples/`: Directory containing example implementations
- `linters/`: Directory containing linter implementations for various languages
- `README.md`: Project overview and quick start guide

## Getting Started

To get started with the Codebase Context Specification:

1. Review the `CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md` file for the full specification
2. Check out the `examples/` directory for implementation examples
3. Use the linters in the `linters/` directory to validate your .context.md files

## Development

To contribute to the Codebase Context Specification:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make your changes and ensure all tests pass
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes

## Quality Assurance

We maintain high-quality standards through:

- Automated linting of .context.md files using Jest and Pytest
- Manual review of all changes to the specification
- Maintaining a test coverage threshold of 90%
- Performance benchmarking for linting speed and memory usage

## Deployment

The Codebase Context Specification is versioned and released through GitHub. We use the following environments:

- GitHub for version control and collaboration
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- GitHub Pages for hosting documentation (staging)
- npm registry for distributing the linter package (production)

Each release goes through the following process:

1. Development and testing on feature branches
2. Merging to the main branch after review
3. Running automated tests and linting
4. Manual review of changes
5. Deployment to staging (documentation update)
6. Final approval and deployment to production (npm package release)
