# AI Context Convention

This project defines and implements the AI Context Convention, a standardized approach to providing context for AI-assisted development. The convention aims to enhance the effectiveness of AI models in understanding and working with codebases.

## Project Structure

- Root directory: Contains configuration files and main documentation

## Key Components

1. Specification: Defined in CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md
2. Reference Implementations:
   - Python: `ai_context_convention/reference_implementation/context_manager.py`
   - TypeScript: `src/reference_implementation/context_manager.ts`
3. Linters:
   - Python: `ai_context_convention/linters/python_linter.py`
   - TypeScript: `src/linters/typescript_linter.ts`

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the specification outlined in CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md
- Ensure all new features have corresponding tests
- Keep the reference implementations in Python and TypeScript in sync
- Update examples when making significant changes to the specification

## Getting Started

Refer to the "Getting Started" section in CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md for setup instructions for both Python and TypeScript environments.
