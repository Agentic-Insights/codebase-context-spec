# Linters Directory

This directory contains linting tools for validating AI Context Convention files in different programming languages. The linters ensure that context files adhere to the specification and provide consistent, high-quality contextual information for AI-assisted development.

## Contents

- `python/`: Python implementation of the context linter
- `typescript/`: TypeScript implementation of the context linter

## Usage

Each language-specific subdirectory contains its own linter implementation. Refer to the README files in each subdirectory for specific usage instructions and requirements.

## Development Guidelines

When contributing to or modifying the linters:

1. Ensure consistency between different language implementations
2. Follow the AI Context Convention Specification strictly
3. Write clear, well-documented code
4. Include appropriate error messages and logging for easier debugging
5. Add unit tests for any new functionality or bug fixes

Please refer to the main README.md file in the project root for more detailed contribution guidelines and the full specification of the AI Context Convention.
