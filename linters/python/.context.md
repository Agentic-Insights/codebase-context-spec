# Python Linter for Codebase Context Specification (Placeholder)

This directory is currently a placeholder for the future Python implementation of the linter for validating Codebase Context Specification files.

## Current Status

The Python linter is not yet implemented. This module serves as a placeholder to indicate the planned development of a Python-based linter for the Codebase Context Specification.

## Planned Functionality

Once implemented, the Python linter is expected to perform the following checks:

1. Validate the structure of context files (.context.md, .context.yaml, and .context.json)
2. Ensure required fields are present
3. Check for proper YAML frontmatter in Markdown files
4. Verify that content adheres to the Codebase Context Specification

## Future Development Guidelines

When the Python linter is developed, it should:

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. Use type hints for better code readability
3. Include unit tests for all functionality
4. Maintain consistency with the TypeScript implementation
5. Include comprehensive comments and docstrings

## Next Steps

1. Determine the specific requirements and scope for the Python linter
2. Assign development resources and set a start date
3. Create a detailed implementation plan
4. Begin development following the project's coding standards and best practices

Refer to the main README.md in the project root for the full Codebase Context Specification and contribution guidelines.
