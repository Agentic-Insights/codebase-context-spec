# Python Linter for AI Context Convention

This directory contains the Python implementation of the linter for validating AI Context Convention files.

## Main Components

- `python_linter.py`: The main linter script that validates `.context.md`, `.context.yaml`, and `.context.json` files.

## Functionality

The Python linter performs the following checks:

1. Validates the structure of context files
2. Ensures required fields are present
3. Checks for proper YAML frontmatter in Markdown files
4. Verifies the content adheres to the AI Context Convention Specification

## Usage

To use the Python linter:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install PyYAML markdown`
3. Run the linter: `python python_linter.py <directory_to_lint>`

## Development Guidelines

When working on the Python linter:

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. Use type hints for better code readability
3. Write unit tests for new functionality
4. Keep the linter consistent with the TypeScript implementation
5. Update comments and docstrings as necessary

Refer to the main README.md in the project root for the full AI Context Convention Specification and contribution guidelines.
